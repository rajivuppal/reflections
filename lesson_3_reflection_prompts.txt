Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. When there is more than one person on a project.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. That way the user has control over when the appropriate changes need to be commited.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. A fork is the same as a clone of a repository but both the original and the cloned repositories are on GitHub.  A clone is a copy of a repository on your local computer.  The original repository that has been cloned can be either local or remote.  A branch is a set of one or more commits that are attached to an existing repository.
